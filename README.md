# Welcome to the Contao project

This is a high-level task tracker for things regarding the Contao community and universum.

If you have a general idea or problem that could improve the Contao universum,
please send an email to [association@contao.org](mailto:association@contao.org).
If your request fits the project, we will open an issue here to track its progress.

Please be aware that **you are always encouraged to tackle projects yourself**!
Contao is a community project, you do not need approval by anyone to launch
a website, create a tool or plan an event! But you're always free to 
ask for opinions, organise the community or get financial support.
